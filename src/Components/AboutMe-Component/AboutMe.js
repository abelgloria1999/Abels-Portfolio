            As a proud child of two hard working immigrants, work ethic had always been a priority. 
            My parents instilled work ethic in me by taking me to work with them. 
            I would help my dad's workers on saturdays. I would help them pick up rocks, sod grass, and trim trees. 
            My mom would always make sure that I took that same work ethic to school. 
            I want to thank my parents for forming me into the person that I am today. 
            I apply the lessons, that my parents taught me, to work, school, and I apply them to my personal relationships. 
            It is honorable to work hard and put full effort into what you are doing.
